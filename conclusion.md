# Conclusion for TICKET-101

## Overview
The intern implemented the MVP scope of the decision engine as part of TICKET-101, providing a REST API endpoint, input validation, a basic loan approval mechanism, and initial tests. While the original implementation had notable strengths, it contained critical flaws that were addressed during the code review process. This review evaluates the intern's work, highlights improvements made, and details the fix for the most significant shortcoming.

## What the Intern Did Well
1. **Project Structure**: The code adheres to Spring Boot best practices with clear separation of concerns (controller, service, constants, exceptions), aligning with the Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID.
2. **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions provide meaningful feedback, seamlessly integrated into the REST controller for proper client communication.
3. **Testing**:
    - Initial integration tests (`DecisionEngineControllerTest`) covered success and error scenarios using MockMvc and Mockito.
    - Unit tests (`DecisionEngineTest`) validated core logic, including edge cases like invalid inputs.
4. **Constants Management**: Key parameters are centralized in `DecisionEngineConstants`, improving maintainability.
5. **Input Validation**: The `verifyInputs` method ensures compliance with basic business rules.

## Areas for Improvement (Initial Version)
1. **Incorrect Scoring Formula**: The original logic (`credit_modifier * loan_period`) did not match the required formula `((credit_modifier / loan_amount) * loan_period) / 10`, and the approval threshold of 0.1 was ignored.
2. **Limited Loan Amount Search**: The engine failed to systematically find the maximum approvable amount or adjust the period when the requested amount was unsuitable.
3. **Personal Code Segmentation**: Hardcoded segmentation (e.g., 0–2499 for debt) did not align with the specific personal codes and modifiers from the task (e.g., `49002010976` → 100).
4. **Period Constraints**: The maximum loan period was set to 60 months instead of the specified 48 months.
5. **Incomplete Test Coverage**: Tests did not verify the search for alternative amounts or periods and used inconsistent personal codes.

## Most Significant Shortcoming
The primary issue in the initial implementation was the **incorrect credit scoring algorithm and lack of loan optimization**. The `highestValidLoanAmount` method used an incorrect formula (`credit_modifier * loan_period`) and did not search for the maximum approvable loan amount or adjust the period as required. This broke the core functionality of offering the highest possible loan amount, even if the requested one was unfeasible.

## Fix for the Main Shortcoming
The scoring algorithm was corrected to use the specified formula: `((credit_modifier / loan_amount) * loan_period) / 10`, implemented in the `calculateCreditScore` method with a threshold of 0.1 (`CREDIT_SCORE_THRESHOLD`). A new method, `findMaxLoanAmount`, iterates from 10000 to 2000 (in steps of 100) to find the largest amount with a credit score >= 0.1. If the requested amount fails, the engine now searches for an alternative period (12 to 48 months) to maximize the loan amount within constraints. Additionally, the `Decision` class was refactored: the `errorMessage` field was removed, shifting error handling entirely to exceptions caught in the controller. This aligns with the requirement to return the maximum approvable sum and simplifies the data model.

## Additional Improvements
- **Accurate Segmentation**: The `getCreditModifier` method was updated to use a `switch` statement matching the exact personal codes from the task (e.g., `49002010965` → debt, `49002010976` → 100).
- **Period Correction**: `MAXIMUM_LOAN_PERIOD` was adjusted from 60 to 48 months.
- **Code Modernization**:
    - The `Decision` class was refactored into a `record` for conciseness, removing `errorMessage` to enforce a cleaner separation of concerns (data vs. error handling).
    - `DecisionResponse` initialization was changed in `DecisionEngineController`: instead of being a Spring-managed `@Component` dependency, it is now created locally with `new DecisionResponse()` per request. This ensures thread-safety by avoiding shared state across requests, reduces coupling with Spring, and aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle by treating `DecisionResponse` as a simple DTO.
- **Exception Simplification**: Custom exceptions (e.g., `InvalidLoanAmountException`) were streamlined by inheriting directly from `Exception`, removing redundant fields like `cause` and related methods, improving readability and consistency.
- **Enhanced Testing**:
    - Integration tests were updated to use task-specific personal codes (e.g., `49002010998`) and verify realistic outcomes (e.g., 4000 → 10000 for segment 3).
    - Unit tests now align with the task’s examples, testing exact scenarios (e.g., segment 1: 4000 → 2000, period 20) and covering the loan optimization logic.
- **Minor Refinements**:
    - Constants in `DecisionEngineConstants` were changed from `Integer` to `int` to use primitive types, reducing overhead from autoboxing and improving performance in arithmetic operations.
    - The credit score threshold (0.1) was extracted into a named constant `CREDIT_SCORE_THRESHOLD`, enhancing code readability and maintainability by making the magic number explicit.
    - `@UtilityClass` from Lombok was added to `DecisionEngineConstants` to enforce its static nature and prevent instantiation.

## Conclusion
The revised implementation resolves the critical flaws of the original code, delivering a robust decision engine that meets the requirements of TICKET-101. The improvements enhance functionality, test coverage, and adherence to SOLID principles (e.g., Single Responsibility by separating error handling from decision data and ensuring thread-safe response handling), while minor refinements improve performance and readability. The result is a more reliable and maintainable solution.
