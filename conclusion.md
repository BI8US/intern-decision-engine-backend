# Conclusion for TICKET-101

## Overview
The intern implemented the MVP scope of the decision engine as part of TICKET-101, providing a REST API endpoint, input validation, and a basic loan approval mechanism. The initial implementation had a solid conceptual foundation but was hindered by an inefficient and incomplete application of the logic. After refinement, the final version fully aligns with the task’s objective: determining the maximum approvable sum, regardless of the requested amount, with a fallback to a suitable period for the requested sum when necessary.

## What the Intern Did Well
- **Project Structure**: The code follows Spring Boot best practices with clear separation of concerns (controller, service, constants, exceptions), adhering to SOLID’s Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions provide clear feedback, integrated into the REST controller for effective communication.
- **Testing**: Initial integration and unit tests covered success and error scenarios, later refined for task-specific cases.
- **Constants Management**: Key parameters are centralized in `DecisionEngineConstants`, enhancing maintainability.
- **Input Validation**: The `verifyInputs` method enforces business rules consistently.
- **Core Formula**: The intern’s `highestValidLoanAmount` method used `credit_modifier * loan_period`, which correctly aligns with the maximum sum concept when tied to the credit score threshold.

## Areas for Improvement (Initial Version)
- **Inefficient Logic Structure**: The `while` loop incremented `loanPeriod` arbitrarily without first checking the maximum sum for the requested period or systematically supporting the requested amount.
- **Incomplete Optimization**: Ignored the requested loan amount entirely, missing the requirement to fallback to it with an adjusted period when the maximum was insufficient.
- **Personal Code Segmentation**: Used hardcoded ranges (e.g., 0–2499 for debt) instead of task-specific personal codes (e.g., `49002010976` → 100).
- **Period Constraints**: Set the maximum loan period to 60 months instead of the required 48 months.
- **Limited Test Coverage**: Early tests did not validate the full logic of maximum sum prioritization and period adjustment.
- **Overcomplication**: Several areas of the code could have been simplified; for example, the custom exceptions (`InvalidPersonalCodeException`, `InvalidLoanAmountException`, etc.) could have been consolidated into a single generic exception with descriptive messages, reducing boilerplate while retaining clarity.

## Most Significant Shortcoming
The primary flaw in the initial version was the **inefficient and incomplete application of the loan approval logic**. While the intern’s formula `credit_modifier * loan_period` was conceptually sound—implicitly yielding `credit_score = ((credit_modifier / (credit_modifier * loan_period)) * loan_period) / 10 = 0.1`—the implementation:
- Did not prioritize the maximum approvable sum for the requested period before adjusting the period, as required by "determine what would be the maximum sum, regardless of the person requested loan amount."
- Used an unbounded `while` loop that only incremented the period upward, risking an infinite loop or missing optimal solutions, instead of a structured approach.
- Failed to incorporate a fallback to the requested sum with a suitable period, as specified: "if a suitable loan amount is not found within the selected period, find a new suitable period."

## Fix for the Main Shortcoming
The revised `calculateApprovedLoan` method refines this approach into a clear, efficient solution:
- **Step 1**: Uses `findMaxLoanAmount` (`credit_modifier * loan_period`) to calculate the maximum approvable sum for the requested period, capped at 10000 and validated against a minimum of 2000. This formula, inherited from the intern, is derived from the task’s credit score equation: setting `credit_score = 0.1`, we solve `0.1 = ((credit_modifier / loan_amount) * loan_period) / 10`, yielding `loan_amount = credit_modifier * loan_period`.
- **Step 2**: If the maximum is insufficient (< 2000), employs `findMinLoanPeriod` (`loan_amount / credit_modifier`) to compute the shortest period (within 12–48 months) that supports the requested sum. This is derived by rearranging the same equation: `loan_period = loan_amount / credit_modifier`, ensuring `credit_score = 0.1`.
- **Outcome**: This satisfies the task’s dual requirement. For example, with `credit_modifier = 300`, `loanAmount = 4000`, `loanPeriod = 12`, it returns `(3600, 12)`; with `credit_modifier = 100`, it returns `(4000, 40)`.

## Additional Improvements
- **Modernized Data Structure**: Simplified the `Decision` class by converting it to a `record`, removing the `errorMessage` parameter, reducing boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, `toString`), and leveraging Java’s concise syntax for immutable data, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Thread-Safe Controller**: Refactored `DecisionEngineController` to initialize `DecisionResponse` locally within the method rather than as a field, preventing potential overwrites from concurrent user requests and ensuring thread safety in a multi-user environment.
- **Streamlined Exceptions**: Updated custom exceptions to extend `Exception` instead of `Throwable`, removing unnecessary complexity (e.g., redundant constructors), aligning with best practices, and reducing the risk of catching overly broad errors.
- **Accurate Segmentation**: Updated `getCreditModifier` to use a `switch` statement with task-specific personal codes (e.g., `49002010965` → debt, `49002010976` → 100), replacing hardcoded ranges for precise task compliance.
- **Period Correction**: Adjusted `MAXIMUM_LOAN_PERIOD` from 60 to 48 months, aligning with the task’s constraints and preventing out-of-bounds errors.
- **Optimized Logic**: Replaced the inefficient `while` loop with direct calculations (`findMaxLoanAmount` and `findMinLoanPeriod`), eliminating the risk of infinite loops and enhancing performance.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Enhanced unit and integration tests to fully validate the updated logic, covering all segments (debt, 100, 300, 1000), edge cases (invalid inputs, boundary values), and error scenarios, ensuring robustness and correctness.

## Conclusion
The final implementation meets TICKET-101’s objectives by delivering a decision engine that first seeks the maximum approvable sum for the requested period and, if unsuccessful, adjusts the period to accommodate the requested amount. The intern’s initial formula (`credit_modifier * loan_period`) was a strong foundation, correctly tied to the credit scoring logic, but required a structured approach to fully comply with the task. The refined version enhances this with significant architectural improvements, efficiency, correctness, and comprehensive test coverage, while adhering to SOLID principles, making it a robust, maintainable solution ready for production use.
